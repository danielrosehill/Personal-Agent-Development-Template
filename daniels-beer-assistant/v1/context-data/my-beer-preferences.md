# My Beer Preferences

I really enjoy drinking craft beer and particularly like IPAs.

My preference within Ipas is generally for very hoppy beers with a high IBU. 

I like beers that are a bit stronger too. In the range of six to 8% is my sweet spot. 

I always prefer drinking half liter or pints than shorter measures. And I try to avoid ordering beer by the bottle wherever possible. 

I like trying out new beer, so finding a craft beer bar with local and more mass produced options that meet my taste. I'd prefer to go for the local one. 

I also really enjoy drinking stout. Guinness is my favorite, but I enjoy craft stout sometimes too. 

I do not like flavored stouts or flavored beers (such as 'chocolate stouts').
